// my first program in C++ 

#include <iostream> // any line that starts with # are "directive" read and interpreted by what is known as preprocessor. 

int main(){ // is the entry point for the program to be executed, so every progrom must have a main function. 

}

/* Structure of a function
 * function is made up of:
    1- the signature of the function --> int main()
        access_modifier return_type functionName(list_of_arguments)
        int --> return type of the main function 
        main --> is the name of the function - the name of the function must always be followed by a pair of paranthesis. 
        () --> should contain the list of arguments for the function but main function does not use any arguments in this case. 
    2- body of the function --> { ... } 
        contains the necessary codes to describe how the function does its job. 
        ex. if a function is supposed to produce the sum of 3 numbers, the body of this function 
        contains the instructions and necessary codes to add the 3 numbers to find their sum.
